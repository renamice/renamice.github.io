I wonder how one is supposed to be a human though. Humanity, for better or worse, is a master at giving birth to myths and legends. We try to weave everything into a story often times not caring if it fits or not.\nHumans are indecisive. Still, we trust our young ones to take decisions that will stick with them for the rest of their lives. But if we don’t then we just raise a generation of people who have nowhere to turn to when they grow up. That, still, does not make our current solution the best one either; we just raise a generation with solid choices, but not so solid of a foundation for a happy life. I suppose this is favourable for only those people who were lucky enough to find their passion at a young age.\n“Let me guess, you still think you have enough time.”1\nIn reality some of us are so indecisive that we end up choosing whatever seems right while convincing ourselves that it is the right path; only realizing our wrongs way too late. This, of course, usually does not lead to a fulfilling life.\nStill, humanity loves to complicate things for itself. If there is nothing to do we will come up with something to do for ourselves; at least that is how it should be. The modern advancement of technology serves everything for people on a silver platter which is nearly impossible to ignore. Our opinions are not our own, neither is our judgement. We just accept what the algorithms pushes, and we are often delighted on this personalized myth and legend that might not even be grounded in reality.\nThe world does not automatically become a better place even if we all just heal from social media, though. Sooner or later we will be digging ourselves another grave thinking we are on the right path towards new innovation and future.\nStill though, “the puzzle is the point.”2\nEven with all these advancements and what not, humans still do crave something to do, something to create, and something to strive for. Let that not be stolen by anything.\nI think, being human should also constitute for the roller-coaster of emotions. Some self-induces some through our surrounding and the people around us. Some people feel misery at the slightest hint of politics being mentioned in a conversation while some people thrive in such conditions. Some people like to indulge in food while some prefer sports.\nStill, what unites the entire humanity is that we all love something.\nIt must be a cruel punishment for someone to be nobody at nowhere doing nothing.\nSo, how does one become human? I know not of the answer, but what I do know is that it shouldn’t be something that one concerns oneself with. Everyone is a human in their own right, and no one should have the authority to overrule that. We all carry a piece of humanity within us, and what matters is not that we strive to be “humans”, but that we strive to be better than yesterday.\nBe Happy.\nBe Unusual.\nBe Mad.\nBe Angry.\nBe Naive.\nBe human.\nReferences [1] Dogen, Goodnight PunPun, The Psychology of the Disillusioned Foreigner\n[2] Digging The Greats, The Irony of AI Generated “Art” and “Music”\n","wordCount":"563","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-03-15T21:08:52+05:45","dateModified":"2025-03-15T21:08:52+05:45","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rena Mice"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://renamice.github.io/posts/be_human/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"rena","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://renamice.github.io/assets/favicon/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://renamice.github.io/ accesskey=h title="rena (Alt + H)">rena</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://renamice.github.io/archive/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://renamice.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://renamice.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://renamice.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Be human.</h1><div class=post-description>Trying to reason about what it means to be 'human'.</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-03-15 21:08:52 +0545 +0545'>March 15, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;563 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Rena Mice</div></header><div class=post-content><p>&ldquo;Learn to be a human first&rdquo;, my dad once said to me.
